## Solution

### Overview:

The "Chunk Array" problem requires breaking down a given array into smaller chunks, where each chunk should contain a specified maximum number of elements. The main challenge is to devise an efficient solution that maintains the order of elements while forming these chunks.

### Approach 1: Using a Loop

In this approach, we utilize a loop to iterate over the input array and create chunks of the specified size.

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the chunks: `const chunks = []`.
2. Start a loop that iterates through the array with a step size of `chunkSize`.
3. For each iteration, use the `slice` method to create a chunk from the current index to the current index + `chunkSize`.
4. Push the sliced chunk into the `chunks` array.
5. Continue the loop until you've iterated over the entire array.
6. Return the `chunks` array.

#### Implementation:

```javascript
function chunkArray(arr, chunkSize) {
  const chunks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += chunkSize) {
    chunks.push(arr.slice(i, i + chunkSize));
  }
  return chunks;
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the need to store all the chunks.

### Approach 2: Using `splice`

In this approach, we use the `splice` method to repeatedly extract chunks from the array until it's empty.

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the chunks: `const chunks = []`.
2. Start a loop that continues until the array is empty.
3. Inside the loop, use `splice` to remove the first `chunkSize` elements from the array.
4. Push the extracted chunk into the `chunks` array.
5. Continue the loop until the array is empty.
6. Return the `chunks` array.

#### Implementation:

```javascript
function chunkArray(arr, chunkSize) {
  const chunks = [];
  while (arr.length > 0) {
    chunks.push(arr.splice(0, chunkSize));
  }
  return chunks;
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the need to store all the chunks.

### Approach 3: Using `reduce`

In this approach, we use the `reduce` function to build the array of chunks incrementally.

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. Use the `reduce` function on the input array.
2. For each iteration, check the length of the current chunk. If it's not equal to `chunkSize`, add the current element to the current chunk.
3. If the current chunk's length becomes equal to `chunkSize`, start a new chunk and continue adding elements.
4. Return the final array of chunks.

#### Implementation:

```javascript
function chunkArray(arr, chunkSize) {
  return arr.reduce((acc, current) => {
    const lastChunk = acc[acc.length - 1];
    if (!lastChunk || lastChunk.length === chunkSize) {
      acc.push([current]);
    } else {
      lastChunk.push(current);
    }
    return acc;
  }, []);
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the need to store all the chunks.

**Conclusion:**
All three approaches provide valid solutions to the Chunk Array problem. They have similar time and space complexities, making them suitable for various scenarios. The choice of approach depends on factors such as code readability, ease of understanding, and potential memory considerations. When solving similar problems in real-world scenarios, it's important to consider the trade-offs and requirements of your specific use case.
